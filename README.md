This is a fork of the excellent [Eight-Five-Zero](https://github.com/jrm4/Eight-Five-Zero) responsive template for Zim exports by jrm4.

I have basically:
1. Removed jQuery because I don't need it.
2. Changed the line-height CSS property to be unitless. Read why [here](https://ronitray.xyz/posts/line-height-units-css)
3. Added a CSS overflow-x rule to make code blocks play well with smaller screen sizes.
4. Changed the font to Roboto-Slab, because I like it.

TODO (not a priority though):
1. I will try to move the navigation to the bottom on mobile devices as described but not delivered by the original theme. Currently it is at the top of the page.

This template is in action on [my personal wiki](https://wiki.ronitray.xyz/).

Many thanks to the creators of the original [Zim](http://zim-wiki.org), literally the best program I've ever used.
